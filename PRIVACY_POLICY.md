# Secure Zip Notes Privacy Policy

DiTronic Apps built Secure Zip Notes with privacy and security as the top priority.
By default, Secure Zip Notes is a pure "offline app".
The only exception is the optional sync with a cloud backend (e.g. Dropbox).
Even if cloud sync is enabled, the cloud provider is still not able to decrypt the data since Secure Zip Notes encrypts all notes locally before uploading them.
Secure Zip Notes uses the oauth2 protocol to access Dropbox.
Secure Zip Notes only requests the minimal oauth2 scopes that are necessary for creating app-specific files.
Therefore, Secure Zip Notes does not have the permission to access any cloud files that have not been generated by Secure Zip Notes.
Secure Zip Notes is open-source.
If you are suspicious about the implementation of Secure Zip Notes, then you can review the source code at https://github.com/fkirc/secure-zip-notes.
